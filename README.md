# ExtractIQ: Document Intelligence & RAG-Powered Chat

ExtractIQ is a Streamlit-based AI application that processes **image-based PDFs** using OCR, embeds their content, and enables intelligent question-answering via **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)** using Google's Gemini.

---

## Features

- Multi-PDF upload support
- OCR via Tesseract for scanned documents
- Semantic chunking & embedding using Sentence Transformers
- FAISS vector search for fast retrieval
- Context-aware querying with Gemini (Gemini 1.5 Flash)
- Streamlit chat UI for document Q&A

---

## How It Works

1. **Upload PDFs** → multiple scanned PDFs are supported
2. **OCR** → Extract text from each page using Tesseract
3. **Chunk & Embed** → Text is chunked and encoded into vectors
4. **Store in FAISS** → Fast vector search over chunks
5. **Ask Questions** → Query is matched to chunks, and Gemini generates answers
